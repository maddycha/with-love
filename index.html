                this collection is made up of survey responses from people who identify as lgbtq+. each page lists an important object in an individualâ€™s life, why they find it important, and how they identify.
                <br><br>
                this collection serves as a form of representation of these individuals through these objects. the purpose of this project is to showcase items that people may be able to connect with or relate to their own lives. while this may not resonate with everyone, i hope that it can bring validation through shared identity and/or experience.
