                the survey for this project was distributed over social media, with the requirement that people wanting to participate must identify as lgbtq+. participants were asked to provide their identity, a short description of an object they care about, as well as why they cared about it. additionally, participants were given the option to send links to images of the objects.
                <br><br>
                this website was created in conjunction with a print piece so that participants would be able to view the final project and the visual representation of their contribution. documentation for the project is currently in progress and will be linked in the near future.
                <br><br>
